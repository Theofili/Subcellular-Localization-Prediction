# Subcellular Localization Prediction Using Pre-trained Mistral Models

This markdown contains the full workflow of creating a function which predicts the location of user inputed proteins.

# 1. Collecting Data

## In the `data/data_functions` folder run:

### 1.1. `average.py`
When executed this program:
* Collects **human protein sequences** from the Entrez-protein database. 
* Calculates the lengths of the sequences.
* Prints statistics like mean, sd and distribution of lengths.
* Prints **lower (5%) and upper (95%) bound** for sequence lengths.

These numbers are used to filter out extremely short or long protein sequences, because they are often biological artifacts (fragments, chimeras, or annotation errors) and donâ€™t represent typical proteins. From a computational side, very short or long sequences create inefficiencies in batching, increase memory cost, and can destabilize training. By restricting lengths to a reasonable range, the model focuses on biologically meaningful proteins and trains more efficiently.

*Average length is calculated on proteins from human and not only from the ones used to train - if trained data is used upper bound is higher due to in general longer extracellular protein sequences. Don't know which bounds should be used.*

### 1.2 `model_dataframes.py`
When executed this program:
* Creates dataframes with proteins pulled from Entrez which have a *particular word* in title. In this case it is cell locations(nuclear, membrane, mitochondrial, etc.)
* Filters through duplicates and sequence lengths based on the average length.
* **Creates 50:50 binary classification dataframes for each cell location** -- Adjust sample sizes to number of target sequences
* Dataframes saved in `data/model_data` folder (naming = `model_{cell_location}_data.csv`)

Each cell location contains different numbers of sequences, and for that reason total number of sequences differ. Each dataframe contains a `sequence` column and a `type` column. When `type==1` sequence exist in the location written in the title of the dataframe, when `type==0` sequence exists in any other location in the cell.

***Doesn't use** user input, collects data from 9 cellular locations (Reticulum, Extracellular, Golgi, Membrane, Mitochondria, Nuclear, Peroxisome, Reticulum, Ribosome)*

---

All dataframes created are saved as csv's, as well as saved fasta files from Entrez.


# 2. Fine tuning the models

## In the `models folder` run:

### 2.1 `Model_{cellular_location}.py`

When executed these programms:
* Initializes training parameters.
* Splits coresponding dataframe into training(80%), validation(10%), testing(10%) sets. *Saved as csv's*
* Trains the `RaphaelMourad/Mistral-Peptide-v1-15M` model on the datasets.
* Saves results each epoch.
* Saves the model in each own folder.

Each program needs to run individually and beacause of different training dataset sizes, some models perform better than others.

After filtering:

|Type|Sequences Count|
|-----|-------------|
|Extracellular|160|
|Golgi|456|
|Mitochondrial|2749|
|Membrane|3698|
|Nuclear|2561|
|Peroxisome|236|
|Reticulum|431|
|Ribosome|164|



**Most important parameters:**
* Learning rate: 2e-5
* Number of epochs: 20
* Max length: 1000
* Early stopping patience: 3

Some other paramters can be changed for the model to train faster, in better performing hardware (batch_size, number of epochs, bf16)

*Lysosome dataframe did not have sufficient amount of sequences, therefore there is no model.*

### 2.2 `Localization.py`
When executed this program:
* Puts a user-inputted sequence through all models.
* **Prints the model that yields the highest score**
* Prints all model scores
* If no model hits a score above 0.5, `'Not Matched'` is printed
